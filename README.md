# 4NEC2_helical_gen
source code to generate .nec files for helical wire antennas. Purpose is to generate simulations that will help with the mechanical design of the antenna. 

# Code Structure
Will have a class to handle creating the correct geometry for the antenna. Then we'll use a handler to translate the geometry into a .nec file for simulation.
