## Setting up the python environement

The packages required to run the python scripts are:
- numpy
- matplotlib

In order to run the packages easily use the folowing instructions:
### Ubuntu

Fist of all get pip (Pip Installs Packages), open a console (Ctrl+Alt+T default) and type:
```
sudo apt-get install pip
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then get the modules
```
sudo pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Finally get the GUI packages tkinter
```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
```

Alternatively, opening a console in this directory an running the folowing command is equivalent:
```
bash python-setups.sh
```
